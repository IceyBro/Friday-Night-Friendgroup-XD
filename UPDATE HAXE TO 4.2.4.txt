You don't have to stay
We're nearly out of time
But you're doing fine
So stay on track
And don't look back
Just feel the pace
Come on now, race!
Everybody's Super Sonic racing
Try to keep your feet right on the ground
When you're Super Sonic racing
There's no time to look around
We're just Super Sonic racing
Running to the point of no return
Everybody's Super Sonic racing
Come on, let the fire burn
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody
